                </a>

                <p>Sniper is a Unum tool which provides self service for workarounds defined by problem management throughout multiple Unum applications. These workarounds are implemented as temporary fixes to allow the business process to proceed with minimal interruption to service. Sniper temporary fixes are released when repetitive incidents of the same data fix are identified.</p>
                <p>I was Scrum Master for this project leading a team of 6 developers to build the Web Application from scratch using technologies such as Angular.js, Bootstrap and SQL. I was also heavily involved in the look and feel of the application and created an information site and brochure which you can view.</p>

				</header>

				<a target="_blank" href="http://patrickkillalea.com/wheredonationsgo" class="image featured">
					<img src="images/LightThroughTrees_final.jpg" alt="" />
				</a>

                <p>This site was built with help from one of my friends who works in Concern. We were concerned that the charity scandals of recent years were taking its toll on donations in Ireland and wanted to do something to counteract it.</br>
                We decided to create a website which rates all Irish charities and compares them against each other by using fancy visualizations.</br>
                We take the information that charities publish in their annual reports and standardise it. This means you can see what your favourite charity is doing with your donation. And you can compare it with other charities.</p>

					<h2>Mapper Self Serve</h2>
				</header>

				<a class="image featured">
					<img src="images/mapperbanner.jpg" alt="" />
				</a>

				<p>Mapper Self Serve is a Unum web application which allows business users who are discussing a clients data feed needs to create a sample file for the client which they can email to IT.</br>
				Doing this saves a large amount of testing time and shows prospective clients that we have the ability to deliver exactly what the want.</p>
                <p>I acted as Scrum Master for this project leading a team of 4 developers. We wanted the app to be as user friendly as possible so we built it to look like an iPhone/iPad app using JQuery and interacting with a SQL database using Ajax.</p>

					<h2>EDI On Call</h2>
				</header>

				<a class="image featured">
					<img src="images/edioncall.jpg" alt="" />
				</a>

				<p>EDI On Call is another Unum web app which allows on call IT staff to check queues in our production environment. If there was a failure, the on call person can use the app to look through the various job settings to determine why it failed.</br>
				The person is then able to rerun the job either straight away or schedule it to run at a later date. The app also allows users to navigate through all jobs in the system and make various modifications if required.</p>
                <p>I lead a team of 3 developers for this project. We reused some code from Mapper Self Serve so it is built using JQuery, SQL and Ajax.</p>

					<h2>Coffee Order System</h2>
				</header>

				<a class="image featured">
					<img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" />
				</a>

				<p>The coffee ordering system is an app which allows employees to order boxes of coffee once a month. When people are finished ordering, the person ordering from the supplier can log onto their own admin screen where they see exactly what they need to order and who ordered what.</br>
                It was a project I used as a training experience for one of our interns whos project hadnt started yet and replaced a spreadsheet on sharepoint. It is now used by over 50 people each month.</p>
